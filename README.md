# TMBHelper

Very WIP

§§§---- How to use ----§§§
- After install open the tmb helper page under interface options.
- Navigate to your TMB guild page and locate the export button within the admin dropdown
- View CSV for "Loot Received, Wishlists, Prios, and Notes" copy that entire list and paste it into the text field and click the button.

This needs to be done whenever you make a change on TMB website.
hold alt while viewing a hover tooltip to change the view to recieved.
