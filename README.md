# TMBHelper

Extremly WIP

§§§---- How to use ----§§§
- After install open the tmb helper page under interface options.
- Navigate to your TMB guild page and locate the export button within the admin dropdown
- View CSV for the following lists
    * Wishlists -> Copy text and paste into addon, click Wishlist
    * Prios     -> Copy text and paste into addon, click Prio list
    * All Items -> Copy text and paste into addon, click All items

That should really be it. There are no configuration options atm. I'm working on it.
Currently im working on implementing Ace3 since it enables better GUI design.
However the core functionality is there.
